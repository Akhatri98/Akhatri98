Hi! My name is Adeel(he/him). I'm interested in all things programming, but more importantly, I'm interested in Machine Learning and big data. I'm a student studying at an undergraduate level, so I'm constantly
Looking to learn more.

currently, I'm learning front-end web design, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm also expanding my programming knowledge and increasing my proficiency in Java. In my free time, I'm also studying the implications
of Python for data analysis.

As a hobby, I do game development using Unity and Blender. These are also some aspects that I'm willing to collaborate on.
